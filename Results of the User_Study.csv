Subjective, but fun and creative patterns that makes you want to come back.;Parity - Getting rid of triangles and DDs will go a long way. Ease up on the random difficulty spikes where certain sections are over-mapped compared to other sections of the map. Flow - A lot of times the setup for the pattern isn't quite there, and calls for unnatural arm/wrist movements to be able to hit the next block comfortably. Patterns - Bad cutty patterns. There were a good number of challenge patterns in the pool like loloppes, hidden notes as well as a lot of unnecessary clutter, flicky and uncomfortable hits would help.;"*See above. A lot of clutter that is hard to read, lack of flow, bad-cutty, and lack of any ""wow"" factors.";Minimal representation, parity issues, uncomfortable hits, overall lack of feeling that any block placement was intentional.;"Good setup into the next pattern. One cut doesn't interfere with any other surrounding blocks. It could be emulated if the software could recognize forehand/backhand hit, and where sabers end up after cutting a block as well as where sabers start before cutting a block.

However, there are definitely parts where the map felt inconsistent in the representation of the mapping itself. Whether or not BeatKenja is a new mapper or an AI was hard to tell because the patterning made sense just representation was inconsistent. The later maps (Malefisole, Requiem Harumachi) were unreadable messes with resets and awkward patterning akin to a first map you would see in the testplays in the mapping or BSMG discords.;;Good representation of the music through the mapping style (speed, tech, acc, challenge) with patterns that make sense on a first or second playthrough at the skill of the player it is meant for. The other is consistency of the mapping throughout the map. Lastly and most important is having low errors in mapping like vision blocks, double directionals, controller clashing. No one wants to play a map that is littered with errors making it hard to read. In the end this question is biased each player likes a different style and will always give different answers.;I cant answer this question due to lack of knowledge of how auto-mappers work. I can tell what is wrong and probably why, but not how to improve. From what I saw in the editor it seems like the bot is trying to get the info from the spectrogram so high noise maps will confuse it and put it off time. As for obvious errors, just put it through an error checker. :);For higher noise maps, faster or bass boosted there seems to be a discrepancy of representation like the map is not correctly timed and you cant tell what notes are being played to. For easier maps or ones where the auto-mapper doesn't have errors, its the fact that there are little patterns that feel awkward, uncomfortable or too wide. Usually these are subtle but noticeable when played.;Incorrect bpm timing, high errors count, inconsistency in the representation of notes. Mostly like the person is not listening to the song and just placing notes.;If the player can hit the next note easily from where the last note ended to where the next notes swing starts. A decent way to check for good flow and something I found recently in the map editor is using arc notes to check how the player moves to swing at each note.;I simply cannot read them there are so many resets and just jumbled notes. This sentiment applies to the last 6 maps in the playlist.;5
