# Beat Saber Automapper Analysis

[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Pages-Live-blue)](https://chrisvenator.github.io/BeatSaberAutomapperAnalysis/)

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of automapper-generated Beat Saber maps, evaluating their quality, playability, and fun factor. The project provides visualizations, statistics, and comparisons to manually mapped levels.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Beat Saber Automapper Analysis project aims to assess different automappers by analyzing their output and comparing them to human-made maps. It focuses on:

- **Automapper Evaluation**: Examining how well procedural generation performs.
- **Fun Factor Analysis**: Comparing subjective ratings from player feedback.
- **Statistical Breakdown**: Providing insights into note patterns, complexity, and playability.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displaying results through dynamic charts and graphs.

## ðŸ“Š Data & Methods

This project gathers data from various Beat Saber automappers and evaluates their output using:

- **Quantitative Metrics** (e.g., note density, variation, complexity)
- **User Study Feedback** (fun ratings from real players)
- **Visualization Techniques** (heatmaps, charts, comparative breakdowns)

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Comparative analysis** of different automappers.
- **Dynamic charts** for performance insights.
- **Exportable statistics** for further research.
- **Player feedback integration** for fun factor evaluation.
