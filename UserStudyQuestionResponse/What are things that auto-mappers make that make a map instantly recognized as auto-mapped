1: While they do work timing wise (well, sometimes.), it feels like someone gave AI timings and told it to map the song, without actually hearing the song. So some things feel way too heavy on a light sound and vice versa.
2: Incorrect bpm timing, high errors count, inconsistency in the representation of notes. Mostly like the person is not listening to the song and just placing notes.
3: Minimal representation, parity issues, uncomfortable hits, overall lack of feeling that any block placement was intentional.
4: resets that no human would ever map (like in a stream or faster linear pattern), bad music representation
5: It being off beat all the time, or it not having notes where is still song, and random blocks
6: sometimes its when the notes are mapped to the vocals and instruments simultaneously
7: unsure? some of my own handmade maps have had some similar patterns to automappers
8: They lack soul, blocks on spots that make no sense to the song or the cut flow
9: Cant answer in a single sentence, I just know it, my game sense tells me that
10: resets, uncomfortable patterns, notes that are placed where theres no sound
11: when the map is uploaded 2025 but feels 2029-2020-2021
12: the amount of notes and the way they are mapped
13: no or very little coherency between notes
14: i think stacking blocks in random moments
15: up note starts, resets.
16: the lack of flow
17: 2018 patterns
18: resets
