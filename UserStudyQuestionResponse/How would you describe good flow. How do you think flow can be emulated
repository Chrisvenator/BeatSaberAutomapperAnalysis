1: Good setup into the next pattern. One cut doesn't interfere with any other surrounding blocks. It could be emulated if the software could recognize forehand/backhand hit, and where sabers end up after cutting a block as well as where sabers start before cutting a block. Maybe if it went with something like "if we were to connect all the blocks with a line, and the curve exceeds ____, then it should be changed", it might work better?
2: If the player can hit the next note easily from where the last note ended to where the next notes swing starts. A decent way to check for good flow and something I found recently in the map editor is using arc notes to check how the player moves to swing at each note.
3: in simple terms, sort of a dance. not everything has to be a super dance map but when the notes are placed just right, the player's movement naturally goes to its place and/or angle
4: when player just letting their body move around and play map by itself, dont need full focus because some scarejump gonna show up, something what dont match the rest of the map
5: Good flow is when the map doesnt surprise you with sth you didnt expect AT ALL. When there's a pattern that breaks the whole vibe of a map youre currently playing
6: Good buildups, fun rotations that move with the tone of the song etc. Something AI can't replicate unless it hears the song.
7: Good flow is when you dont reset, the pattern makes sense, and it feels good to move with it
8: a lot of good flow has to do with the swing momentum AND the riming of the notes combined
9: good flow is when you feel like you are playing the song to a certain degree
10: flow is good when there are no random map style changes and no RESETS
11: patterns that match the music
