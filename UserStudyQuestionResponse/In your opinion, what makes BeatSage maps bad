1: Everything xD I don't think I can name a single thing I like about BeatSage maps. They're the worst in all regards, and they're the one thing I have banned from stream requests other than any maps over 6 mins.
2: I wouldn't say they are bad, there are some beatsage maps that I really enjoy, but it feels like they are still a work in progress when I see badly mapped maps
3: I simply cannot read them there are so many resets and just jumbled notes. This sentiment applies to the last 6 maps in the playlist.
4: not ALL of them are bad but the only quip i have for beat sage is the stagnant 120bpm being auto chosen no matter what
5: Everything, no flow, not following the beat, awkward block placements, long breaks
6: They are randomized, no flow etc, unexpected angles, limited to 16 njs
7: Oddly enough I don't mind Beat Sage maps, at least in lower diffs.
8: Bad flow, random resets, dont follow the beat at all
9: Random angles, some mistimings and bad flow.
10: it has resets and is worse than 2018 mapping
11: random note placements, lack of parity
12: terrible parity, maps barely playable
13: the lack of flow
14: random patterns
15: everything lol
16: everything
