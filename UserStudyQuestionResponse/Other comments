1: the difference between the AI and Human, is there's intentions and directions that humans have compared to a hollow AI that lacks creativity and imagination. Since maps are sort of a creation of art, the AI fails to capture how we imagine ourselves to move and dance on certain sections of the song(s).
2: Maps made by humans felt very natural, but the ones made by AI just felt like a "map". They're not bad maps, but they're not good maps either. It just feels like it was there to exist. Not to be played. It's like someone was forced to map something that they don't like, just to produce a map.
3: Gurenge (the BeatKenja one) is by far my favorite autogenerated/hybrid map out of all of these. not only does it fit my normal playstyle, but its genuinely mapped well. i will 100% play that map again and add to my favorites
4: I was honestly impressed by the auto-mapped Rolling Girl. I was expecting more maps like the latter half the entire way
5: I feel like Auto-generated has become better than it used to be, but still barely playable imo
6: The latter maps in the list were atrocious
7: overall solid maps by BeatKenja
