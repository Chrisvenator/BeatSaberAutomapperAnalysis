1: For higher noise maps, faster or bass boosted there seems to be a discrepancy of representation like the map is not correctly timed and you cant tell what notes are being played to. For easier maps or ones where the auto-mapper doesn't have errors, its the fact that there are little patterns that feel awkward, uncomfortable or too wide. Usually these are subtle but noticeable when played.
2: too much blocks in calm moments and not enouch more in dynamic parts; blocks dont fit the music; too much same patterns; hitting myself or my controllers/headset; pain caused by too aggressive movements/resets
3: resets, vision blocks, stacked notes, up-starts or other common mapping errors, overmapping slower sections, undermapping faster sections
4: Put unnecesary diagonal or sideway angles when the map doesnt require it. Making simple parts unnecesarly hard
5: *See above A lot of clutter that is hard to read, lack of flow, bad-cutty, and lack of any "wow" factors.
6: not following parity, clearly offtime parts and sudden diffspikes which dont follow the song
7: unsure how to answer this properly but it may be evident in some of my other answers
8: unfitting parity breaks, sometimes blocks on of the offbeat and sometimes not
9: resets, wide patterns, other note in the cut-path, off-time notes
10: Not fit the beat, or just random notes, and uncomfortable swings
11: 2018 style of no parity and ultra fast NJS that makes no sense
12: parity, random wall or mines, linear patterns, outdated feel
13: Patterns that do not fit the song at all, mostly.
14: It just feels a little random with the angles.
15: resets, dd's, 0 flow and 2 notes in 1 üò≠üôè
16: resets, overly wide patterns
17: resets, mostly
18: resets
